# udemy.com-project
This is a team project with two member team. Here in this project, we will be creating a web application with the same features and functionalities that udemy.com has. Here we will be using whole MERN in our project. This project will be created from scratch and we will be implementing all the features from the user view and admin view as well. Here admin can create course and can modify in the course and user can visit the course, purchase the paid courses and many more features we will be implementing.
